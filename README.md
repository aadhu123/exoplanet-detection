# exoplanet-detection

This repository is linked to a bachelor thesis, which will be added at a later point in time. The main objective of the research paper is to create an automated pipeline for detecting exoplanets using the light curves obtained by the Kepler mission. These light curves can be found on [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/). The code first downloads light curve data, which it then casts into plots of equal width and height. These images are then passed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) made with TensorFlow (thanks Google). The CNN filters out the graphs with potential exoplanets in them and logs the Kepler IDs (KIC ID) in a log file generated in this directory. Now you have some KIC IDs, you can more closely investigate these star systems. Good luck hunting exoplanets!

This project requires Python3.

## How to use (not yet working)
 - Fork the repo, clone your forked repo
 - Run the command `python3 main.py` (this file does not exists yet)
 - The exoplanet candidates will be output in the file `./logs/{currentISOdate}`
